Jess Salomon is from an Anglo Montreal family that wasn’t scared away by Separatists. They had a family meeting in the 1990’s and decided they’d rather never speak English again than live in Toronto. In this hour, Jess treats you to a mélange of jokes and stories about what it’s like to grow up in an Anglo bubble and try to move beyond it, even if when you French you sound like a politician from Calgary trying to win votes in Quebec.
